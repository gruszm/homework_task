# Day 2 & 3

* Imported the signals from the .json
* Linked the signals to the `Available signals` list
* Fixed scrolling of the list
* Added a `Line` graph and passed the data from the .json file to visualize the checked signals
* Set the colors to bet assigned dynamically and uniquely
* Trimmed the timestamp labels to 3 decimal points
* Some optimization (via `memo`/`useMemo`)*

_*Noticed issue: despite optimization, there is a noticable lag every time the `Available signals` list is updated_
